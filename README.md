        <h2>Destination Details:</h2>
        <h3>Athens</h3>
        <p>In Athens, you will stay at a beautiful modern hotel, Athens Lodge, right in the streets of Athens. It is in a place called Monastiraki. There is a hip restaurant in the building, as well as a colorful desert place right across the street. It is about a 20 minuite walk to the Acropolis  -right in all the action. You can end your day with a nice cold drink on the rooftop patio, overlooking the city.</p>

        <h3>Paros</h3>
        <p>Paros is a beautiful place to relax and it has many beautiful beaches. The hotel you will be staying at, Agnanti Hotel, actually has a <em>private beach</em> as well as a pool. The hotel itself is very breathtaking and you are guaranteed a good time. If you travel with our company, you have a free boat tour that will take you to 3 places around Paros that have the clearest water ever imaginable. The tour offers snorkling, live music, and a wonderful dinner onboard.</p>

        <h3>Santorini</h3>
        <p>As you may have heard, Santorini is <strong>gorgeous.</strong> There are so many beautiful buildings and hotels. I wouldn't recomend going to Santorini to swim, but for the sights of course. You will stay at the Ilioperato Hotel, which is a very fancy and comforting family-owned hotel. You can have breakfast above the clouds, overlooking the ocean. You can also travel to Oia -which is the part of Santorini that you always see in photos- with a free taxi if you travel with our company.</p>

        <h3>Cyprus</h3>
        <p> Cyprus is beautiful to visit for the culture. It is a great cooldown for the last days of your trip. You will stay at a hotel called Central Park Residence. This hotel is beautiful and the customer service is extraordinary. There is a relaxing pool, and each room has a balcony that overlooks the city. You can also visit Lania which is a small village in the mountains with amazing Greek cuisine to taste. There are of course many beautiful beaches to visit in Cyprus as well.</p>
